# Deep Learning Applied to COVID-19 Detection in X-Ray Images

## Summary
This repository contains the source code developed during the course of our research project, intended to develop a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) tool for the COVID-19 disease using X-Ray images and Deep Learning methods. The code available covers from database processing and manipulation, preprocessing techniques to training, and evaluation, of classification and object detection models. It is recommended to run these notebooks using the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) platform.

## Contents
### Folders
- **utils:** contains Python files (.py) with various useful functions used in most notebooks. These functions include metrics, preprocessing operations, GradCam, among others.

### Files
- **Database Processing - NPY from DICOM:** create a binary file (.npy) containing all the images from a directory structure and DICOM format. Faster load times and saves disk space.

- **Database Processing - Frontal and Lateral Projection Filtering:** training and evaluation of a model to classify chest X-Ray images based on the projection it was taken from.

- **Database Processing - Lung Segmentation:** training and evaluation of a U-Net model to perform semantic segmentation of the lung region in chest X-Ray images.

- **COVID-19 Classification with VGG16 and VGG19:** training and evaluation of VGG16 and VGG19 models to classify chest X-Ray images into positive or negative for COVID-19.

- **COVID-19 Detection in X-Ray Images using Convolutional Neural Networks:** full experimental setup for the paper *[COVID-19 detection in X-ray images using convolutional neural networks][1]* (2021).

- **GGO Localization with Bounding Boxes and YOLOv5:** training and evaluation of the [YOLOv5][2] algorithm to detect Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) in chest X-Ray images.

- **GGO Segmentation:** training and evaluation of multiple semantic segmentation models to detect Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) in chest X-Ray images.

## Data sources
In the development of this project we have used multiple databases, most of them are publicly available, but others remain private with the intention be released soon.

A curated version, including the partition into train, validation and test sets, are available via a [Code Ocean Capsule][3]. In particular, the files published correspond to the ones used in the notebook [COVID-19 Detection in X-Ray Images using Convolutional Neural Networks][4].
